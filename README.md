# MicrobiotaProcess: A comprehensive R package for managing and analyzing microbiome and other ecological data within the tidy framework

This package has many unique features:

  - **MicrobiotaProcess** introduces **MPSE** class, which make this
    package more interoperable with the existing computing ecosystem.
  - **MicrobiotaProcess** can bridge several common tools of microbiome
    analysis with several parsing functions.
  - **MicrobiotaProcess** introduces a tidy microbiome data structure
    paradigm and analysis grammar via formatted output avoiding memory
    consumption.
  - **MicrobiotaProcess** provides a wide variety of microbiome analysis
    procedures under the unified and common framework (tidy-like
    framework). This will make the related analysis easier.
