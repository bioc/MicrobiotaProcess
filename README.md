# MicrobiotaProcess: an R package for analysis, visualization and biomarker discovery of microbiome

MicrobiotaProcess is an R package for analysis, visualization and
biomarker discovery of microbial datasets. It supports calculating alpha
index and provides functions to visualize rarefaction curves. Moreover,
it also supports visualizing the abundance of taxonomy of samples. And
It also provides functions to perform the PCA, PCoA and hierarchical
cluster analysis. In addition, MicrobiotaProcess also provides a method
for the biomarker discovery of metagenome or other datasets.
